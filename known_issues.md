- when a client requests a cursor it may render two cursors for some reason
- hotpluging monitors does not work
- multiple layer surfaces taking keyboard focus probably wont work as intended, as the second one will not get the focus after the first one unmaps; this is going to be fixed in a near future, as it is not that difficult to do
- config arguments longer than 64 characters wont work. need to implement reallocating for such buffers.
